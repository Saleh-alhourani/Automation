## Automate The World 
is a reposetory I have created because I'm too layze to repeat some work more than one time , so what I do is to spent more time creating a script one time and then forget about it. 

ConfigVPS.sh : will install the basic security tools that you may find it useful in Web application Pentesting and API Pentesting 
  this script will  do the folloing : 
  apt update && apt upgrade && apt dist-upgrade 
  make 3 directories in /opt/{tools, wordlist , lab} 
  install python3-pip unzip  apache2 firefox curl git whois  docker.io docker-compose
  install and configure go
  install nmap , metasploit 
  download Seclist wordlist , HackingAPIs wordlist.
